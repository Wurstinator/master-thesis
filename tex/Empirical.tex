\chapter{Experiments}

This chapter focuses on the analysis of the different algorithms in the form of implementation and empirical data.

All techniques for state space reduction were implemented in C++14. The source code can be found in \cite{}. The computer used to run the tests was an Arch Linux 4.19.4 64 bit machine powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 processor and 16 GB DDR4-2400 RAM.
