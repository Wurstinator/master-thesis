\subsection{Alternative computation}
As we have seen, using delayed simulation to build a quotient automaton delivers good results in the number of removed states. The downside is the computation time which is much higher than that of our approach in section \ref{}. In the following we will consider alternations to the delayed simulation algorithm with the goal to increase the number of removed states or to reduce computation time.






\subsubsection{Delayed simulation with normalized priorities}
Additional properties of delayed simulation can be found if we look at only a subclass of all DPAs. In particular, we use automata with normalized priorities here. 

\begin{defn}
	Let $\mathcal{A} = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, c)$ be a parity automaton. We call $c$ \emph{normalized} if for every state $q \in Q$ that does not lie in a trivial SCC and all priorities $k \leq c(q)$, there is a path from $q$ to $q$ such that the lowest priority visited is $k$.
\end{defn}

Algorithm \ref{alg:fwe:normalize_c} shows how an equivalent normalized priority function can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(nk)$, where $n$ and $k$ are the number of states and priorities respectively. The algorithm is a slight adaption of that presented in \cite{}, which is why we will not go into further details here and just refer to the original source.

\begin{algorithm}

  \label{alg:fwe:normalize_c}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Function{Normalize}{$\mathcal{A}$}
      \State $c' : Q \rightarrow \mathbb{N}, q \mapsto c(q)$
      \State \Call{M}{$\mathcal{A}$, $c'$}
      \State \Return{$c'$}
    \EndFunction
    \Statex
    \Function{M}{$\mathcal{A} \upharpoonright_P$, $c'$}
      \If{$P = \emptyset$}
        \State \Return 0
      \EndIf
      \State $min \gets 0$
      \For{SCC $S$ in $\mathcal{A} \upharpoonright_P$}
        \State $m := \min c(S) \mod 2$
        \State $X := c^{-1}(m)$
        \For{$q \in X$}
          \State $c'(q) \gets m$
        \EndFor
        \State $S' := S \setminus X$
        \State $m' \gets $\Call{M}{$\mathcal{A} \upharpoonright_{S'}$, $c'$}
        \If{$m'$ even}
          \If{$m$ even}
            \State $\delta := m$
          \Else
            \State $\delta := m-2$
          \EndIf
        \Else
          \State $\delta := m-1$
        \EndIf
        \For{$q \in S'$}
          \State $c'(q) \gets c'(q) - \delta$
        \EndFor
        \State $min \gets \min \{min, m\}$
      \EndFor
      \State \Return{$min$}
    \EndFunction
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{lem}
	Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a DPA with a normalized priority function and let $p$ and $q$ be states that do not lie in trivial SCCs. Then $p \equiv_\text{de} q$ if and only if $p \sim_M q$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	The \enquote{if}-implication was shown in \ref{}. For the other direction, let $p \not\sim_M q$, so there is a word $w \in \Sigma^*$ such that $c(p') \neq c(q')$, where $p' = \delta^*(p, w)$ and $q' = \delta^*(q, w)$. Without loss of generality, assume $c(p') < c(q')$.
	
	As $c$ is normalized, there is a word $u$ such that $q'$ reaches again $q'$ via $u$ and sees only priorities greater or equal to $c(q')$. That means that on the path that is obtained from $q'$ by reading $u^\omega$, the priority $c(p')$ is never visited. By corollary \ref{cor:fwe:equivde_alternative}, that means $p \not\equiv_\text{de} q$.
\end{proof}
